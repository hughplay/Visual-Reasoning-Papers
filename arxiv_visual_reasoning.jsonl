We find that the\nperformance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time.\nFor example, GPT-4 (March 2023) was reasonable at identifying prime vs.\ncomposite numbers (84% accuracy) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was poor on these same\nquestions (51% accuracy). This is partly explained by a drop in GPT-4's amenity\nto follow chain-of-thought prompting. Interestingly, GPT-3.5 was much better in\nJune than in March in this task. GPT-4 became less willing to answer sensitive\nquestions and opinion survey questions in June than in March.

Here, we\nintroduce a novel visual reasoning benchmark, Compositional Visual Relations\n(CVR), to drive progress towards the development of more data-efficient\nlearning algorithms. We take inspiration from fluidic intelligence and\nnon-verbal reasoning tests and describe a novel method for creating\ncompositions of abstract rules and associated image datasets at scale. Our\nproposed benchmark includes measures of sample efficiency, generalization and\ntransfer across task rules, as well as the ability to leverage\ncompositionality. We systematically evaluate modern neural architectures and\nfind that, surprisingly, convolutional architectures surpass transformer-based\narchitectures across all performance measures in most data regimes.

However, in deliberative reasoning such\nas in VQA, attention is unconstrained at each step, and thus may serve as a\nstatistical pooling mechanism rather than a semantic operation intended to\nselect information relevant to inference. This is because at training time,\nattention is only guided by a very sparse signal (i.e. the answer label) at the\nend of the inference chain. This causes the cross-modality attention weights to\ndeviate from the desired visual-language bindings. To rectify this deviation,\nwe propose to guide the attention mechanism using explicit linguistic-visual\ngrounding. This grounding is derived by connecting structured linguistic\nconcepts in the query to their referents among the visual objects. Here we\nlearn the grounding from the pairing of questions and images alone, without the\nneed for answer annotation or external grounding supervision. This grounding\nguides the attention mechanism inside VQA models through a duality of\nmechanisms: pre-training attention weight calculation and directly guiding the\nweights at inference time on a case-by-case basis. The resultant algorithm is\ncapable of probing attention-based reasoning models, injecting relevant\nassociative knowledge, and regulating the core reasoning process.

Visual relationship between visual contents plays an\nimportant role in image understanding and is the basic for inter-modal\nalignment learning.

To tackle this problem, existing methods mostly\nresort to aligning the visual attention weights with human attentions.\nNevertheless, gathering such human data is laborious and expensive, making it\nburdensome to adapt well-developed models across datasets. To address this\nissue, in this paper, we devise a novel visual attention regularization\napproach, namely AttReg, for better visual grounding in VQA.

The\nvisual perception module parses each video frame into object-centric\ntrajectories and represents them as latent scene representations. The concept\nlearner grounds visual concepts (e.g., color, shape, and material) from these\nobject-centric representations based on the language, thus providing prior\nknowledge for the physics engine. The differentiable physics model, implemented\nas an impulse-based differentiable rigid-body simulator, performs\ndifferentiable physical simulation based on the grounded concepts to infer\nphysical properties, such as mass, restitution, and velocity, by fitting the\nsimulated trajectories into the video observations. Consequently, these learned\nconcepts and physical models can explain what we have seen and imagine what is\nabout to happen in future and counterfactual scenarios.

Particularly, we explore two critical\nresearch problems existed in VQA: (1) efficiently fusing the visual and textual\nmodalities; (2) enabling the visual reasoning ability of VQA models in\nanswering complex questions. To address these challenging problems, a novel\nQuestion Guided Modular Routing Networks (QGMRN) has been proposed in this\npaper. Particularly, The QGMRN is composed of visual, textual and routing\nnetwork. The visual and textual network serve as the backbones for the generic\nfeature extractors of visual and textual modalities. QGMRN can fuse the visual\nand textual modalities at multiple semantic levels. Typically, the visual\nreasoning is facilitated by the routing network in a discrete and stochastic\nway by using Gumbel-Softmax trick for module selection. When the input reaches\na certain modular layer, routing network newly proposed in this paper,\ndynamically selects a portion of modules from that layer to process the input\ndepending on the question features generated by the textual network. It can\nalso learn to reason by routing between the generic modules without additional\nsupervision information or expert knowledge. Benefiting from the dynamic\nrouting mechanism, QGMRN can outperform the previous classical VQA methods by a\nlarge margin and achieve the competitive results against the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Furthermore, attention mechanism is integrated into our QGMRN model\nand thus can further boost the model performance.

As rationale is conditioned on the correct\nanswer, it is based on the assumption that we can solve Visual Question\nAnswering task without any error - which is over ambitious. Moreover, such an\napproach makes both answer and rationale prediction two completely independent\nVQA tasks rendering cognition task meaningless. In this paper, we seek to\naddress these issues by proposing an end-to-end trainable model which considers\nboth answers and their reasons jointly. Specifically, we first predict the\nanswer for the question and then use the chosen answer to predict the\nrationale. However, a trivial design of such a model becomes non-differentiable\nwhich makes it difficult to train. We solve this issue by proposing four\napproaches - softmax, gumbel-softmax, reinforcement learning based sampling and\ndirect cross entropy against all pairs of answers and rationales. We\ndemonstrate through experiments that our model performs competitively against\ncurrent state-of-the-art. We conclude with an analysis of presented approaches\nand discuss avenues for further work.", "comment": null, "links": []}

We\nexperimentally show that our approach improves upon grasping systems whose\ncomponents are not learned end-to-end, including a baseline method that uses\nbounding box detection. Furthermore, we show that jointly training our model\nwith auxiliary data consisting of non-semantic grasping data, as well as\nsemantically labeled images without grasp actions, has the potential to\nsubstantially improve semantic grasping performance.", "comment": "14 pages", "links": []}

Along with the advent of deep convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN), using contextual information with such systems starts to\nreceive attention in the literature. At the same time, aerial imagery is\ngaining momentum. While advances in deep learning make good progress in aerial\nimage analysis, this problem still poses many great challenges. Aerial images\nare often taken under poor lighting conditions and contain low resolution\nobjects, many times occluded by trees or taller buildings. In this domain, in\nparticular, visual context could be of great help, but there are still very few\npapers that consider context in aerial image understanding. Here we introduce\ncontext as a complementary way of recognizing objects. We propose a dual-stream\ndeep neural network model that processes information along two independent\npathways, one for local and another for global visual reasoning. The two are\nlater combined in the final layers of processing. Our model learns to combine\nlocal object appearance as well as information from the larger scene at the\nsame time and in a complementary way, such that together they form a powerful\nclassifier. We test our dual-stream network on the task of segmentation of\nbuildings and roads in aerial images and obtain state-of-the-art results on the\nMassachusetts Buildings Dataset. We also introduce two new datasets, for\nbuildings and road segmentation, respectively, and study the relative\nimportance of local appearance vs. the larger scene, as well as their\nperformance in combination.

Yet, the human visual system is able to\nperform visual reasoning despite having only a small fovea of high visual\nacuity. With this in mind, we wish to understand the extent to which\nconnectionist architectures are able to learn from and reason with low acuity,\ndistorted inputs. Specifically, we train autoencoders to generate full-detail\nimages from low-detail \"foveations\" of those images and then measure their\nability to reconstruct the full-detail images from the foveated versions. By\nvarying the type of foveation, we can study how well the architectures can cope\nwith various types of distortion. We find that the autoencoder compensates for\nlower detail by learning increasingly global feature functions.
